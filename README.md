# TowerWars

Defend you castle by building towers!

## Story
TowerWars is an early version of an iOS game developed by [Tom GÃ¼lenman](mailto:tguelenman@gmail.com) and [Anton Begehr](mailto:a.begehr@gmail.com). At the moment only one tower and a single level is supported. We plan to expand the app and ultimately make it available on the App Store.

## Implementation

We used Apple's SpriteKit for rendering and Apple's GameplayKit for game logic.

Developed with guidance and code snippets from: [https://www.raywenderlich.com/706-gameplaykit-tutorial-entity-component-system-agents-goals-and-behaviors](https://www.raywenderlich.com/706-gameplaykit-tutorial-entity-component-system-agents-goals-and-behaviors)
